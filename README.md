# keywordExtraction

You should be able to replace you venv file with mine in a regular default pycharm project. 

You can try running but might need to install spacy and download the model. 

You should be able to hoover over the spacy import in the keywordExtraction.py file in venv and pycharm will offer to install for you. 

Also can install your project settings or through terminal pip install spacy within the project terminal window. Just make sure pycharm is opened as administrator. 

Can install the en_core_sci_lg model by opening the terminal in your pycharm ide and copy and paste the following command; pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_lg-0.5.1.tar.gz

Once succesfully done you should be able to run the file and it will print the keywords extracted.
